## Getting Started

To get you started you can simply clone the `weather-dashboard` repository and install the dependencies:

### Prerequisites

You need git to clone the `weather-dashboard` repository.

### Clone `weather-dashboard`

Clone the `weather-dashboard` repository using git:

```
git clone https://github.com/shahumang23/weather-dashboard.git
cd weather-dashboard
```

### Install Dependencies

We have two kinds of dependencies in this project: tools and Angular framework code. The tools help
us manage and test the application.

* We get the tools we depend upon via `npm`, the Node package manager.

```
npm install
```

After that, you should find out that you have
below new folders in your project.

* `node_modules` - contains the npm packages for the tools we need

### Run the Application

We have preconfigured the project with a simple development web server. The simplest way to start
this server is:

```
ng start
```

Now browse to the app at [`http://localhost:4200/`].

## Components based architecture

Created components based architecture so in future we can use same components to another application or same application

Here i created 4 components

- City selector
- City's forecast (5 days)
- City's forecast chart

And that components used into app.component.html
